## Why discuss this paper?
- I chose this article because, even after decades of work in the field, we still lack reference spectra, and the vast majority of small molecules lack experimental reference spectra, making the identification of new compounds a difficult task.
- It tackles the fundamental challenge in Mass Spectrometry (MS) of accurately simulating the fragmentation process.
- The results show promise for improved MS-based compound identification.

### Overview of Steps involved in MassFormer
!["Figure 1"](Fig1.png)
<br>

**Molecule to Spectrum**
- Unlike traditional methods, MassFormer utilizes a graph-based approach to represent molecules.
- Incorporating spectral metadata, such as collision energy used during the measurement, allows MassFormer to account for factors that might influence the fragmentation patterns observed in the final spectrum prediction.
- Multihead self-attention : MHA - allows an input to attend to relevant parts of itself
- Multilayer perceptrons : MLPs - capture non-linear relationships between the resulting representation and the final output.

## Results

!["Figure 2"](Fig2.png)
<br>

**Spectrum similarity experiments: Predicted vs. Real spectra for two held-out compounds (Azlocillin and Flamprop-isopropyl)**
- Accurate Predictions: MassFormer can predict realistic mass spectra for held out compounds. The high cosine similarity values (around 0.6) indicate a close match between the predicted and actual spectra.
- Outperforms Existing Models: When compared to other deep learning models (CFM, FP, WLN) on a larger dataset, MassFormer consistently performs better. It shows the highest average cosine similarity across different data splits.
- NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology
- MoNA: MassBank of North America
- FP: Fingerprint (FP) neural network model
- WLN: Weisfeiler–Lehman (WLN) graph neural network model

!["Figure 3"](Fig3.png)
<br>

**Collision energy experiments: Benzhydrylpiperazine**
- MassFormer can not only predict mass spectra accurately but also captures the influence of collision energy on the fragmentation patterns observed in the spectra.
- This ability is important for real-world applications where collision energy is a variable factor during data acquisition. 
- NCEs: Normalized collision energies

**Explainability using gradient attributions: Mass spectrum of propranolol**
- Separation of Nitrogen-Containing Peaks: The gradient attribution maps reveal that nitrogen-containing peaks can be linearly separated from those without nitrogen, demonstrating that the model captures meaningful chemical information related to nitrogen content.
- Improved Classification Accuracy: The linear classification accuracy is significantly higher when using nitrogen labeling compared to random labeling, with nearly half of the peaks being perfectly separable based on their gradient attributions, highlighting the effectiveness of the attributions in distinguishing chemical compositions.
